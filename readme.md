Behold! This Web components modal is an example of using basic JS features to create fully reusable component without any dependencies like React etc.

This is a sandbox project so there are lots of redundant code and `console.log()` to get understanding of web components lifecycle.

To run it just open `index.html` in your browser.

## Features

- Shadow dom
- Slots
- Custom events dispatching and listeners, bubbling, etc
- Data Binding
- Custom events dispatching
- Ugly CSS theming, this is not about design, sorry...
